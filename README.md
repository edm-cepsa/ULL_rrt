rocktyping propagation from core wells to all existing wells


The model will be constructed from the RRT interpertation provided by the OPCO at the core samples, this model will be based on the well logs available in all wells to increase our chances of propagation.

Reviewing the provided data from the OPCO we only have a "log with SRT", therefore the process has been to sample this interpretation to the core data ( it has the depth correction applied , but this is CEPSA correction, as the OPCO has not delivered the official one.

Optimization run working on the set of logs that maximizes the roc_auc for Kharaib and Lekhwair respctively.

The best cases were for Lekhwaair

"XGR"          "XSRES"        "XRHOB"        "XPHIT"        "res_diff_log" "res_diff_lin" "log_XPERM"  

and for KHAraib

"XGR"       "XRHOB"     "XPHIT"     "log_XPERM" "log_XDRES" "log_XSRES"
